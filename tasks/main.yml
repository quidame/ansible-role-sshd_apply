# reset_connection raises an unmanageable error when used with paramiko. This
# meta task doesn't support 'when' conditionals, but fortunately supports tags.
# And ansible 2.5 added special tags 'never' and 'always'. Additionally, as
# ansible_connection is not a gathered fact, and its value is always set by
# ansible entering the playbook, the tag can be set dynamically based on it.
# Also note that prior to ansible 2.5.6, this meta task was buggy and failed
# as well when no control socket was set.

# If the cookie doesn't exist, it means initial ruleset has been restored,

# rollback.  Last but not least, the task that removes the cookie MUST be the
# first task to attempt to connect to the target.  The `wait_for_connection`
# module is unusable here, since if a host is unreachable before the rollback,
# the next task comes too late for all other hosts: rollbacks already happened
# on all of them, whatever safe or not the applied ruleset was.
